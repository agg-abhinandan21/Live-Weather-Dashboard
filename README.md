📍 Cities Covered: Ghaziabad | Meerut | New Delhi | Noida | Panipat
🗓️ Last Updated: 18 July 2025

I'm excited to share my latest project — a Live Weather Dashboard delivering real-time weather, air quality, and forecast data for major cities across North India. Built to support informed, data-driven decisions for health, travel, and environmental awareness.

🔹 Key Features:
🌡️ Real-time temperature & weather conditions (Rain, Cloud, Thunderstorm)
💨 Wind speed, humidity, and visibility tracking
📉 7-day forecast with dynamic temperature trends
🌍 Air Quality Index (AQI) with pollutant breakdown (PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO₂, NO₂, O₃)
🟢 AQI ratings ranging from Good to Hazardous with visual alerts
🌅 Sunrise & Sunset timings
🧭 UV Index, pressure, and rain probability (hourly & daily)

🚨 Special Highlight:
Dynamic AQI indicators to support safer outdoor activity planning and raise awareness of environmental conditions.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python | ReactJS | API Integration | Data Visualization | Figma | UI/UX Design

This dashboard is ideal for public health planning, smart city applications, and environmental monitoring. It reflects the power of data to drive daily decisions and long-term strategies.

📩 I'd love to hear your feedback or collaborate on future real-time dashboards or climate-focused tech solutions.
